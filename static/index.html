		<p> That 70's show was a sit-com about 6 teens adventures living in the town of Wisconsin in 70's. The show last
	8 seasons and was aired on FOX from <em>1998 to 2006.</em> The main characters are <b> Eric, Donna, Fez, Michael, Jackie, 
	and Hyde. </b> </p> <blockquote cite="http://that70sshow.wikia.com/wiki/That_%2770s_Show">Eric Forman is a nerdy teenage boy; Donna Pinciotti is the feminist 
	next-door neighbor and Eric's girlfriend; Steven Hyde, a cynical, hard-rocking stoner and Eric's childhood friend; Michael Kelso, 
	a dim-witted,
	narcissistic ladies man; Jackie Burkhart, a self-involved high school cheerleader overly preoccupied with wealth and status; and 
	Fez, a sometimes goofy foreigner, whose country of origin is ambiguous, whose real name is unknown to all but him, and whose 
	hormones are, at times, out of control. Eric drives a 1969 Vista Cruiser, a station wagon given to him by his father in the first 
	episode.Other main characters include Red Forman, Eric's overbearing war veteran father, obsessed with making "...him a man, 
	which he's not" and using the word "dumb-ass" frequently plus always threatening people with putting his 'foot in your ass'; 
	Eric's overprotective mother, Kitty, who is caught up in trying to be a full-time mom and housewife, while maintaining a job as a 
	nurse in a local hospital; and Laurie Forman, the promiscuous older sister who can do no wrong in the eyes of her father. The show 
	also follows the relationship of Bob Pinciotti and Midge Pinciotti, Donna's parents, both of whom are slow witted and easily 
	influenced by the movements and fads of the '70s, which sometimes places stress on their marriage. Tommy Chong also appears as 
	the recurring character of Leo, the stoner owner of the Foto Hut. </blockquote>

		We're all alright! We're all alright!</p>
